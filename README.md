* This Repository uses **Mongodb Atlas** for storing Users database
* Nothing any uses of Totaljs and Flow 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now We have Another Options Regarding **How to Implement Totaljs in signup Forms**

* There is a separate Folder for that named "contact-form" inside of "stickman-services"
* Now Move inside of "contact-form"
* Run in terminal / command line  `npm install total.js`
* Run `node index.js`
* Open your Browser and go to `http://192.168.43.166:8000/` or `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`
* And you will get this contact-form. And it works fine and all data is saved under **database Folder** inside of contact-form.
* **Still** Code Strcuture of this environment is quite difficult to understand because of improper documentation and less number of community interactions.
